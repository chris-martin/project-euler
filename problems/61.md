Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are
all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Triangle</td>
    <td>P<sub>3,n</sub> = n(n+1)/2</td>
    <td>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Square</td>
    <td>P<sub>4,n</sub> = n<sup>2</sup></td>
    <td>1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pentagonal</td>
    <td>P<sub>5,n</sub> = n(3n-1)/2</td>
    <td>1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hexagonal</td>
    <td>P<sub>6,n</sub> = n(2n-1)</td>
    <td>1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heptagonal</td>
    <td>P<sub>7,n</sub> = n(5n-3)/2</td>
    <td>1, 7, 18, 34, 55, ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Octagonal</td>
    <td>P<sub>8,n</sub> = n(3n-2)</td>
    <td>1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ...</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three
interesting properties.

1. The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first
two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).

2. Each polygonal type: triangle (P<sub>3,127</sub>=8128), square
(P<sub>4,91</sub>=8281), and pentagonal (P<sub>5,44</sub>=2882), is represented
by a different number in the set.

3. This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.

Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for which
each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and
octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set.
