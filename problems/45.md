Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the
following formulae:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Triangle</td>
    <td>T<sub>n</sub>=n(n+1)/2</td>
    <td>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pentagonal</td>
    <td>P<sub>n</sub>=n(3n-1)/2</td>
    <td>1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hexagonal</td>
    <td>H<sub>n</sub>=n(2n-1)</td>
    <td>1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...</td>
  </tr>
</table>

It can be verified that
T<sub>285</sub> = P<sub>165</sub> = H<sub>143</sub> = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
