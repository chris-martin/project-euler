Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

    x^2 – D y^2 = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 649^2 – 13×180^2 = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is
square.

By finding minimal solutions in _x_ for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the
following:

    3^2 – 2 × 2^2 = 1
    2^2 – 3 × 1^2 = 1
    9^2 – 5 × 4^2 = 1
    5^2 – 6 × 2^2 = 1
    8^2 – 7 × 3^2 = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in _x_ for D ≤ 7, the largest _x_ is
obtained when D=5.

Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of _x_ for which the largest
value of _x_ is obtained.
